The scenario I chose to analysis is “A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit” because this has been a significant ethnic dilemma within engineering. As we learned in class, software engineering should have more responsibilities than simply applying technical skills. In addition, company should consider what ethnic issues influence its reputation, long-term development, and even how those ethnic issues bring the negative effects on its employees. First, we learned from readings related to System Thinking. The System Thinking suggest us to view the whole picture rather than the parts. In this scenario, the retailer only sees the short-term profit without overseeing the influences. For a company’s longer-term development, these ethnical issues will ruin the reputation of a company, which can potentially bring legal actions. Secondly, the retailer fails to identify and understand relationship between business’s integrity with other elements, such as society, national security, citizen’s right. More specifically, institutions in society should recognize citizen’s right, protect national security (other nations may obtain the privacy on purpose), and maintain ethical professionalism. Thirdly, the retailer fails to protect its clients’ information, which will potentially losing its customers and decrease the profits eventually. Employees feel being forced to expose others’ privacy in public, which again their beliefs, work ethic and philosophy. The retailer will loss the employees’ trust, which may against HR policy and cause legal actions. 
In Summary, institutions and individuals should always recognize their social responsibilities. As Dr. Goggins explained in class that software engineer should behave in an honest and ethically responsible way. When developing a product, we should always think about social responsibility. We should always have a comprehensive understanding of how the product influence clients, employees, business, and even the society. It is important for us to have a system thinking that can help us understanding the interactions between each element. For example, we should seek professional advice to see if the product would bring legal actions. When we design or improve a product, we should also consider the potentials of having private date exposed to public. If we want others respect our work and recognize our professionalism, we should always remember our social responsibility and maintain a strong ethical standard.
